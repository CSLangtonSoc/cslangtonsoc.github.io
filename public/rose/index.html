        <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
        <p>Monosaccharides are the monomers of carbohydrates.
        <br> common monosacharides:</p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose">glucose</a> 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose ">,fructose</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose">,galactose</a>
        <p>monosaccharides are joined together by glycosidic bonds formed by 
           condensation reactions to form disaccharides. This releases a molecule of water. </p>
      <h4>polysaccharides</h4>
      <p>glycogen and starch are both formed by the condensation of alpha glucose </p>
      <p>cellulose is formed by the condensation of beta glucose</p>

      <h4>starch</h4>
      <p>stores energy in plants and is a mexture of two ppolysaccharides called amylopectin:</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Amylose</span> - an unbranched chain of glucose molecules joined by 1, 4  glycosidic bonds and as a result amylose is coiled and thus a very compact molecule 
      storing a lot of energy.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Amylopectin</span> - branched and made up of glucose molecules joined by 1, 4 and 1, 6
       glycosidic bonds. Due to the presence of many side branches these can be 
      <br>acted upon simultaneously by many enzymes and thus broken down to release  its energy </p>

        <h3>Lipids</h3>
         <p>Lipids are made up of fatty acids. </p>
